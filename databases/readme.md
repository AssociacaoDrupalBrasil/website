# Databases directory
-

The databases directory is used to place dumps from the persistant storages like MySQL, MongoDB and others.

For example if the project is already installed, must have a initial dump to start, and the name of is depending on the branch:
* dev-dump.sql
* qa-dump.sql
* master-dump.sql

Into this directory can be created another named "local" which will be ignored by the git.
